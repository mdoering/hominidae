# Hominidae

Repository containing a Darwin Core Archive representing extant and extinct species of [great apes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae), mostly based on wikipedia 
with special focus on the [human taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_taxonomy).
The dataset is registered in [ChecklistBank](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset/147251) and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/7be186c4-5572-44e6-9f11-69ddbfd95078).

So far only the [Hominini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominini) tribe is covered, but the remaining taxa from the family will follow.
